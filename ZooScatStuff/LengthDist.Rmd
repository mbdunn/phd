## Fitting the distributions
I want to find the best fit for the length measurements I have from the multinet and tucker trawl data. A represenattive length distribution will inform and constrain the model input possibilities.

## Themisto Abuysorum
My measurements are from 3 stations. Gamma distributions ok for most measurements. Not very representative for the larger individuals. I was not able to identify smaller species so I likely only measured the larger ones... i think too much bias to use my data. 
I combined my data with the multi-net measurements done by a professional. The data from the multinet has avoidance issues and is likely biased.
